    "\n",
    "**Research Question: Is there a correlation between a person's loneliness and sex life?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables Being Explored:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*CONNECTION_activities_sex_p3m:* A person's sexual frequency. This is the basis of our analysis, the main variable that is being compared to the others, that will allow us to determine any correlations with sex life.\n",
    "\n",
    "*LONELY_direct:* A person's general loneliness. Since the analysis is fundamentally focused on loneliness, analyzing the variable that directly informs us of participants loneliness is required. **But more nuanced approaches can be taken to our analysis, since loneliness is a lot more than, well, loneliness.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*The More Nuanced Variables:*\n",
    "Since general loneliness can be more subjective for each person, examining the following variables will provide a insight into our analysis for any correlations, if there exists any.\n",
    "\n",
    "*LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated:* A person's isolation. *Perhaps a person has sex with others more frequently because they wish to feel less isolated*\n",
    "\n",
    "*LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_trust:* A person's trust. *A person could avoid sex because they have nobody they can trust*\n",
    "\n",
    "*LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_emptiness:* A person's emptiness. *A person could actively look for sexual activity because they want to feel less empty (similar to isolation in a sense)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:** Due to the categorical nature of the variables at hand, bar plots will be the primary visualization of the variables. Bar plots will also allow us to see any noticable relations between sexual activity and any of our other variables, as we will be able to figure out the proportionality of the variables, as well as their overall frequnecy between one another. Summary statistics such as mean, standard deviatation, and percentiles will not (I believe) do us little service for the purpose of our analysis due to the, once again, categorical nature of our variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "To determine if there exists a correlation between sex life and loneliness, we will perform a Fisher Exact Test on contingency tables between **CONNECTION_activities_sex_p3m** and all the previously mentioned **LONELY** variables. This method will have us generating simulated contingency samples under a null hypothesis, after which we will use a Monte Carlo simulation (I'm fighting chatgpt to make the simulations and the contingency tables work) to calculate our p-value. For the purposes of hypothesis testing, our **$\\alpha = 0.05$**, which will be compared to our p-value. For the purposes of the test, we will assume that our observations are independent of each other and the total of our columns and rows are fixed. There are of course other variables that we are missing out on due to the nature of the question (*e.g. people with partners are most likely more sexually active and simultaneously less lonely than those without a partner. But that is not the focus of the question.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0$: **There is no correlation between sex life and (whatever loneliness variable)**\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_1$: **A correlation does exist between sex life and (whatever loneliness variable)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible results?** Two possibilities exist for each loneliness variable: Either $p <= \\alpha$ (We reject $H_0$) or $p >= \\alpha$ (We fail to reject $H_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question relevance?** With these results we may determine whether or not a person's sexual activity relates to their personal state of loneliness."

    "\n",
    "**Research Question: Do video games affect a person's ability to make new friends?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables Being Explored:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*CONNECTION_activities_new_friend_p3m:* How often respondents make friends. People who find it easier to make new friends would, for the most part, be making friends more frequently than those who do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CONNECTION_activities_computer_games_p3m:* How often respondents play online games with others. There was another similar variable (CONNECTION_activities_onlinegames_p3m), however that variable only referred to online games (games that require internet connection), which is too specific for our question. The frequency of video games in a person's life will be a good measure of its influence in their life, which is the root of our question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:** Similar to analysis 1, since our variables are highly categorical, we will utilize bar plots to visualize our variables. It will allow us to see noticeble relations between friend making and computer activites that we can delve deeper into. Summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles will also be exempt from our visualizations since they are not applicable to our categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:** Similar to analysis 1, we will be conducting a Fisher Exact Test on a contingency table between **CONNECTION_activities_new_friend_p3m** and **CONNECTION_activities_computer_games_p3m**. Our **$\\alpha = 0.05$** for the purpose of hypothesis testing, after which we will generate various simulated contingency samples under a null hypothesis, using a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate a p-value. Similar to analysis 1, we will assume that our observations are independent of each other and the total of our columns and rows are fixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "It must be noted that there could potentially be some inaccuracies with our test, as **CONNECTION_activities_computer_games_p3m** refers to two similar, albeit different questions: ***How often do you play computer/console games with others?*** and ***How often do you play video or BOARD games with others?*** The board game aspect, as well as the fact that these questions relate to playing games with others could result in inaccurate conclusions as a whole, but for the purposes of our question, we shall assume that the variable only refers to video games, and that those who do **not** play video games with **others** are included in this statistic.\n",

    "**Hypothesis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0$: **Video game activity is not related to the frequency of making new friends**\n",

    "$H_1$: **Video game activity is related to the frequency of making new friends**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Results?** $p <= \\alpha$ (Reject $H_0$) or $p > \\alpha$ (Fail to reject $H_0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question Relevance?** If we can determine that relation does or doesn't exist between video game activity and friend making, then we can determine if video games do or do not affect the capacity to make friends."

    "\n",
    "**Research Question: Does familial emotional support have an effect on mental health?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables Being Explored:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_scale_family_emotional:* How a respondent feels about the emotional support received from their family. This variable is fundamental for answering our question, as it allows us to study any potential effects that emotional support from family, or lack thereof, has on people.\n",
    "\n",
    "*WELLNESS_malach_pines_burnout_measure_depressed:* How often a respondent feels depressed. Depression is a large indicator of a person's current mental state, so examining any relation between depression frequency and emotional support will be crucial towards any sort of conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "*WELLNESS_malach_pines_burnout_measure_helpless:* How often a respondent feels helpless. Helplessness is a state of feeling like you have no control over your life, sort of an offshoot of depression. While respondents could say that they're not depressed, they could still state that they often feel helpless, meaning its important to look into the relation of these more specific mental states.\n",
    "\n",
    "*WELLNESS_malach_pines_burnout_measure_worthless:* How often a respondent feels worthless. Also often a symptom of depression, worthlessness is a huge indicator of a person's mental state. People who do not value themselves need help to realize that they do have self-worth, and drawing a relation between familial emotional support and worthlessness is a sure-fire way to emphasize the importance of aid from close ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:** Similar to the previous two analyses, bar plots will be the main way of visualizing any sort of comparison between our variables. Once again, it will allow us to notice any outstanding relations/proportions between the variables of mental health and family emotional support, but once again, since our variables are all highly categorical, we cannot make effective use of the numerical summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:** Like the previous two analyses, we will utilize the Fisher Exact Test on contingency tables, with there going to be 3 tables of each wellness variable in comparison to the familial emotional support variable. Our $\\alpha = 0.05$ for the hypothesis testing for each contingency table, where we will generate simulated contingency tables under the null hypothesis for each wellness variable, where we then use a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate each respective p-value. We will assume that our observations for each contingency table is independent and that the sum of the rows and columns are fixed.\n",
