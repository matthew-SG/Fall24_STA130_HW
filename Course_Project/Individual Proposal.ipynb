    "**Research Question: Is there a correlation between a person's loneliness and sex life?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables Being Explored:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*CONNECTION_activities_sex_p3m:* A person's sexual frequency. This variable is the basis of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*LONELY_direct:* A person's general loneliness. Most direct approach to resolving our question.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Less Direct Variables*\n",
    "\n",
    "*LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated:* A person's isolation. Sexual activity could correlate to feeling less/more isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "*LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_trust:* A person's trust. Sexual activity could correlate to trust-issues\n",
    "\n",
    "*LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_emptiness:* A person's emptiness. Sexual activity could correlate to a feeling more/less empty (similar to isolation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:** Due to the categorical nature of the variables at hand, bar plots will be the primary visualization of the variables. Bar plots will also allow us to see any noticable relations between sexual activity and any of our other variables, as well as their overall frequnecy between one another. Summary statistics such as mean, standard deviatation, and percentiles will not (I believe) do us little service for the purpose of our analysis due to the categorical nature of our variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "To determine if there exists a correlation between sex life and loneliness, we will perform a Fisher Exact Test on contingency tables between **CONNECTION_activities_sex_p3m** and all the previously mentioned **LONELY** variables. This method will have us generating simulated contingency samples under a null hypothesis, after which we will use a Monte Carlo simulation (I'm fighting chatgpt to make the simulations and the contingency tables work) to calculate our p-value. For the purposes of hypothesis testing, our **$\\alpha = 0.05$**, which will be compared to our p-value. For the purposes of the test, we will assume that our observations are independent of each other and the total of our columns and rows are fixed. There are of course other variables that we are missing out on due to the nature of the question (*e.g. people with partners are most likely more sexually active and simultaneously less lonely than those without a partner*) But that is not the focus of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0$: **There is no correlation between sex life and (whatever loneliness variable)**\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_1$: **A correlation does exist between sex life and (whatever loneliness variable)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible results?** Two possibilities exist for each loneliness variable: Either $p <= \\alpha$ (We reject $H_0$) or $p >= \\alpha$ (We fail to reject $H_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question relevance?** With these results we may determine whether or not a person's sexual activity relates to their personal state of loneliness."

    "**Variables Being Explored:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*CONNECTION_activities_new_friend_p3m:* How often respondents make friends. People who find it easier to make new friends would, for the most part, be making friends more frequently than those who do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CONNECTION_activities_computer_games_p3m:* How often respondents play video games with others. The frequency of video games in a person's life will be a good measure of its influence in their life, which is the root of our question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:** Similar to analysis 1, since our variables are highly categorical, we will utilize bar plots to visualize our variables. It will allow us to see noticeble relations between friend making and computer activites that we can delve deeper into. Summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles will also be exempt from our visualizations since they are not applicable to our categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:** Similar to analysis 1, we will be conducting a Fisher Exact Test on a contingency table between **CONNECTION_activities_new_friend_p3m** and **CONNECTION_activities_computer_games_p3m**. Our **$\\alpha = 0.05$** for the purpose of hypothesis testing, after which we will generate various simulated contingency samples under a null hypothesis, using a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate a p-value. Similar to analysis 1, we will assume that our observations are independent of each other and the total of our columns and rows are fixed. \n",

    "It must be noted that there could potentially be some inaccuracies with our test, as **CONNECTION_activities_computer_games_p3m** includes a two questions, one of which asks respondents how often they play **board games** with others, and the other **video games**. For the purposes of our question, we shall assume that the variable only refers to video games.\n",

    "\n",
    "*PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_scale_family_emotional:* How a respondent feels about the emotional support received from their family. This variable is fundamental for answering our question, as it allows us to study any potential effects that emotional support from family, or lack thereof, has on people.\n",

    "\n",
    "*WELLNESS_malach_pines_burnout_measure_worthless:* How often a respondent feels worthless. Also typically an offshoot of depression, this variable would also provide further insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:** Similar to the previous two analyses, bar plots will be the main way of visualizing any sort of comparison between our variables. Once again, it will allow us to notice any outstanding relations/proportions between the variables of mental health and family emotional support, but once again, since our variables are all highly categorical, we cannot make effective use of the numerical summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:** Like the previous two analyses, we will utilize the Fisher Exact Test on contingency tables, with there going to be 3 tables of each wellness variable in comparison to the familial emotional support variable. Our $\\alpha = 0.05$ for the hypothesis testing for each contingency table, where we will generate simulated contingency tables under the null hypothesis for each wellness variable, where we then use a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate each respective p-value. We will assume that our observations for each contingency table is independent and that the sum of the rows and columns are fixed.\n",
